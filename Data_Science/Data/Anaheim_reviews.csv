Anaheim,Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge,169,Theme Parks,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Dr., Anaheim, CA 92802",NA,,"Seemed so realistic. So much attention to detail from the ""city"" itself to the employees staying in character. We rode both Smugglers Run and Rise of the Resistance. So awesome and worth the wait! We made reservations at Oga's Cantina. While it was neat, it was not worth the"

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"This ride was a lot of fun!  I don't typically enjoy raft rides because I don't find them all that fun and you generally get soaked.  Yes, we got pretty wet but there wasn't a lot of water coming from the top which was nice because usually it is your head that gets soaked.  Keep"
Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"The ride itself was fun when it was working. Got stopped on the climb up twice, and got stopped multiple times before drops to allow for rafts to get farther ahead. Don't think they timed it right. When we were moving it was fun."

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"This ride is definitely my favorite ride between both of the parks! You get into a circular raft which takes you though what looks like a river running through a national park. There are a couple of drops, but nothing too scary.

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,This is a fantastic ride which we went on this ride late one night and it was quite a cool night not the best ride to go on as you do get quite wet but it would be great through the day time so you dry out pretty quick.

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"The perfect ride for a very hot day in California. To guarantee getting soaked, try to be the last person on when boarding. It appeared to work twice for us! I make no 100% guarantees.

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"I don't like getting wet, but sometimes I make exceptions. This was the first time I used a Fast Pass to reduce the wait time. I put my camera in the bag, protected it as best  I could, and prepared to get wet.

Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,I would recommend at least doing once if you never have. It's fun but has a bit more spinning than I would prefer.
Anaheim,Grizzly River Run,68,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Grizzly Peak, Anaheim, CA",NA,,"Fantastic water ride - enough drops, twists and turns to make it interesting but not too many to make it too scary for younger kids. Make use of fast passes as lines can get quite long."

Anaheim,Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,89,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Tomorrowland, Anaheim, CA",NA,,Used fast pass. Went quick to board. Used electric scooter to loading dock. Guns were not that accurate and hard to hit objects. Fun time but Toy Story balls shooting in California Adventures was better. Must be secrets for those high scores.

Anaheim,Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,89,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Tomorrowland, Anaheim, CA",NA,,We love this very slow ride where you try to score as much as you can by firing Astro blasters at various targets during the ride. I am truly amazed at the very high scores some people obtain that I can never seem to match. I never tire of this ride and can do it several times
Anaheim,Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,89,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Tomorrowland, Anaheim, CA",NA,,You shoot at various aliens and score points as you hit the targets along the ride. The ride chair can swivel round to maximise targets. Good fun.

Overall it is a super fun ride!"
Anaheim,Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,89,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Tomorrowland, Anaheim, CA",NA,,This is a great ride for little kids.

Anaheim,Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters,89,Rides & Activities,,4.5,"1313 Disneyland Drive Tomorrowland, Anaheim, CA",NA,,This ride is really cool! You get to go in and use a laser gun to shoot at targets. Your vehicle has a little knob you can use to spin yourself around and around as you shoot.
